<h1> Cryptography Workshop in C </h1>

<h2> Description </h2>

This repository contains materials and exercises for a workshop on Cryptography in C. It's aimed at providing introductory-level cryptographic exercises, including implementations of the Caesar Cipher, Substitution Cipher, and XOR Cipher.


<h2> Installation and Setup </h2>
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/FrancoisDupontEpitech/Workshop-Cryptography.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```
cd Workshop_cryptographie_en_C
```


<h2> Usage </h2>
Each exercise is contained in its own directory. To compile and run an exercise, use the following commands:

<h2> Caesar Cipher Encryption </h2>
Navigate to exercice_1, compile and run:

```
gcc caesar_encrypt.c
./a.out [text_to_encrypt] [shift]
```

<h2> Caesar Cipher Decryption </h2>
Navigate to exercice_2, compile and run:

```
gcc caesar_decrypt.c
./a.out [text_to_decrypt] [shift]
```

<h2> Substitution Cipher Encryption </h2>
Navigate to exercice_3, compile and run:

```
gcc substitute_encrypt.c
./a.out [text] [shift]
```

<h2> Substitution Cipher Decryption </h2>
Navigate to exercice_4, compile and run:

```
gcc substitute_decrypt.c
./a.out [text] [shift]
```

<h2> XOR Cipher </h2>
Navigate to exercice_5, compile and run:

```
gcc xor_encrypt_decrypt.c
./a.out [text] [key]
```
