# Cryptography Workshop in C

# Description

This repository contains materials and exercises for a workshop on Cryptography in C. It's aimed at providing introductory-level cryptographic exercises, including implementations of the Caesar Cipher, Substitution Cipher, and XOR Cipher.


# Installation and Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/FrancoisDupontEpitech/Workshop_cryptographie_en_C.git

Navigate to the cloned directory:

cd Workshop_cryptographie_en_C


# Usage

Each exercise is contained in its own directory. To compile and run an exercise, use the following commands:

# Caesar Cipher Encryption

Navigate to exercice_1, compile and run:

gcc caesar_encrypt.c
./a.out [text_to_encrypt] [shift]

# Caesar Cipher Decryption

Navigate to exercice_2, compile and run:

gcc caesar_decrypt.c
./a.out [text_to_decrypt] [shift]

# Substitution Cipher Encryption

Navigate to exercice_3, compile and run:

gcc substitute_encrypt.c
./a.out [text] [shift]

# Substitution Cipher Decryption

Navigate to exercice_4, compile and run:

gcc substitute_decrypt.c
./a.out [text] [shift]

# XOR Cipher

Navigate to exercice_5, compile and run:

gcc xor_encrypt_decrypt.c
./a.out [text] [key]
